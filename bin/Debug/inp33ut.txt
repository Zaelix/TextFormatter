BEST ZELDA RAP EVER LYRICS

Hey, hey
All right
Yeah
Aww yeah

My name is link y'all, I'm straight outta Hyrule
Been on the force of good since 1986, Old School.
I'm bringing you a laid back summertime jam
Hold on a minute Link! Hey what's up Old Man?

I see that you're embarking on another epic quest
You're gonna use your ocarina to rescue the princess
But you'll need a magic weapon that'll never ever miss
It's dangerous to go alone, TAKE THIS!

Oh thanks old man, that is really very nice
I can always count on you for help and friendly advice
Though I've never seen a sword of quite that shape or size
Oh God that's not a sword it's your dick in disguise!

Yes I can't lie I have painted my shween
	Now grab your destiny if you know what I mean
		Wait a minute Link don't leave the cave
			Where do you think you're going?
		This is a great chance to fondle scrotum that you're blowing

That. was. weird but whatever there is no time to lose
I've gotta warp right now to Zelda in this chilled out groove
Wait this isn't Gannon's lair, I'm in Liberty City
This place looks just like Philadelphia but even more shitty

	I'm at the corner of Dead Cop and Prostitute Junction
	Something in my Ocarina must have gone and malfunctioned
	I gotta fix it quickly there is justice to do
	Hold on a minute Link! Old Man, is that you?

This is a place you can't survive with just your sword and your wits
It's dangerous to go alone, TAKE THIS!
Well that's really kind of...DAHHH that's your wrinkled dick again!
Look I know I wear a tunic but I'm NOT INTO MEN
1
Don't be that way bitch, let me introduce you;
To my three best friends: Mr Johnson and the juice crew
If you see the Princess Zelda, well you know you're gonna grab her
So why don't you try to come grab my inflatable poo jabber?

OH MY GOD
I've got to warp out of here, Princess Zelda awaits
I must defeat Gannondorf before it gets too late
Ok...now I REALLY don't know where I am
Hold on a minute Link!  GodDAMMIT Old Man!!

You're in Raccoon City, it's a zombie abyss
It's dangerous to go alone, TAKE-
NO!  FUCK YOU!  FUCK YOU I'M NOT GIVING YOU- 
I'M NOT TOUCHING YOUR- STOP THE CHILLED OUT GROOVE
GEEZE
